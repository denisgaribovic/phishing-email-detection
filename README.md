# 🛡️📧 Phishing Email Detection

## What’s This Project About?

This project focuses on **detecting phishing emails** — those tricky emails that try to fool people into giving away passwords, credit card info, or clicking harmful links. Phishing is a big cybersecurity threat that can cause identity theft, money loss, and damage to companies’ reputations.

## 📚 About the Dataset 

The dataset used here is the **CEAS 2008 Email Dataset (CEAS_08)**, a well-known collection of emails for phishing research. It contains thousands of emails, both **phishing** and **legitimate** (safe), labeled for training machine learning models.  

Each email in the dataset includes:  
- The raw email text (including headers and body)  
- Labels marking whether the email is phishing or not  
- Extracted metadata like sender email address, URLs found in the email, and domains of those URLs

This dataset provides a rich variety of examples to help models learn what makes phishing emails different from real ones.

## 🎯 The Goal 

The main aim is to create a **machine learning model** that can automatically detect phishing emails by analyzing their content and metadata. This means:  
- Helping users and companies block phishing before harm is done  
- Protecting personal and financial information  
- Saving time by automating email security  
- Enhancing existing email filtering and cybersecurity systems

## 💼 Why This Matters for Business 

- **Prevents phishing attacks** before they reach employees or customers  
- **Reduces financial loss and fraud risk** by catching scams early  
- **Increases trust and safety** in company communications  
- **Saves time and costs** by automating email threat detection  
- **Can be integrated** with email gateways, security platforms, or customer support tools to boost protection
